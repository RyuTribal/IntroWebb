I'm Ivan, an 18 year old student from Ã–stra Gymnasiet. I have always had both an artistic side
and a technical side. The struggle has always been to balance these two almost complete opposite halfs. That's where programming and 3D-animating coming in. But with me I never like to be limited and love being active which is why I also stay in shape and play basketball. My personal belief is to always become better which is why I do everything in my power to become the very best.

* **My strengths**
    * 3D-Moddelling, 3D-Sculpting and 3D-Animating(Maya, Mudbox)
    * Programming(C#, Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript)
    * Leadership
    * Teamwork
    * Language(Swedish, Russian, English, Japanese)

** Why you should hire me
Very few are as passionate as me when it comes to the work I do. Motivation is never an issue as learning and improving is in my blood. Few people are as technically knowledgable and yet have that artistic side, always a learner but also a leader, always calm and sociable yet prepared to do whatever it takes to complete the task and that is something I believe every company needs, what you need.
